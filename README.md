# Pro079
A plugin to enhance playing 079 by giving it some fancy commands to play with, becuase the whole spanish community agreed that playing SCP-079 is boring, this plugin gives him more stuff to not be bored to literal death.

# Translations

# API Guide

This plugin features an API with which you can add new commands/ultimates via plugins (similar to gamemodes/itemmanager)
Please, check this one for reference, and use it as a template to get things done quick: https://github.com/BuildBoy12/Pro079Template

As well as this is a really poorly detailed template, it's the basics and you could explore everything else for yourself by checking the [Manager.cs](https://github.com/BuildBoy12/pro079/blob/master/pro079/Manager.cs) and [Config079.cs](https://github.com/BuildBoy12/pro079/blob/master/pro079/Config079.cs) classes themselves.
