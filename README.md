# Pro079
A plugin to enhance playing 079 by giving it some fancy commands to play with, becuase the whole spanish community agreed that playing SCP-079 is boring, this plugin gives him more stuff to not be bored to literal death.

# Discord
## I now have a Discord where you can get pinged and all of that each time I do something cool, or where you can publish your own commands to: https://discord.gg/cBWuSrR

# Configs

**Check the wiki to get a detailed explanation of every single config here:** https://github.com/RogerFK/pro079/wiki

# Translations
Just place one of the translations into your sm_translations folder and you're good to go! Defaults to english, this plugin will autogenerate the default translation if you're missing any

# API Guide

This plugin features an API with which you can add new commands/ultimates via plugins (similar to gamemodes/itemmanager)
Please, check this one for reference, and use it as a template to get things done quick: https://github.com/RogerFK/Pro079Template

As well as this is a really poorly detailed template, it's the basics and you could explore everything else for yourself by checking the (Manager.cs)[https://github.com/RogerFK/pro079/blob/master/pro079/Manager.cs] and (Config079.cs)[https://github.com/RogerFK/pro079/blob/master/pro079/Config079.cs] classes themselves.
