## Development of this plugin is delayed until 05/26. I know how to fix most of the bugs but still feel free to add an Issue if you find anything really little. The plugin is hardly done for a complete public release. Also, it's licensed with a GPLv3 license, so don't try anything stupid, do a Pull Request and you'll be happilly credited.
