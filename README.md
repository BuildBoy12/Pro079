# pro079
A plugin to enhance playing 079 by giving it some fancy commands to play with, becuase the whole spanish community agreed that playing SCP-079 is boring, this plugin gives him more stuff to not be bored to literal death.

# Configs

*Wiki with **all** the configurations (you should check this one):* https://github.com/RogerFK/pro079/wiki
**The only feature disabled by default is `p079_chaos`. If you want to use it, you have to enable it.**

This plugin take many configs. The basic ones, that work between features, are as follows:

| Config Option | Value Type | Default Value | Description |
|:-----------------------:|:----------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| pro079_enable | boolean | True | Enables/Disables this plugin |
| pro079_feature | boolean | True | Enables X feature |
| pro079_feature_cooldown | float | (Depends on each command) | Cooldown for the command |
| pro079_feature_level | float | (Depends on each command) | Minimum level for that feature |
| pro079_feature_cost | float | (Depends on each command) | Cost for that feature |

# Translations
Just place one of the translations into your sm_translations folder and you're good to go! Defaults to english, this plugin will autogenerate the default translation if you're missing any

# Upcoming features
**Next release (v2.0) will come with custom command functionality, in the future it'll be used like Gamemode Manager and it'll take different .dll's in case you want to slap things like calling chaos as a custom ultimate, or if you just want to add new fake messages**

This is a hard task for me to do, so I'll do a pre-release with just ultimates. *Note: It'll probably be a dictionary with actions or something like that, but I'm not really sure how it should be done. I'm new at C#, so take it easy on me.*
