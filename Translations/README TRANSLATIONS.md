# Important info
To use translations, you only have to place 1 .txt file inside sm_translations, and it will automatically register them. If you change it to <whatever>.txt, it will not create a new file unless you're missing some translation

That means that you just have to download one of these translations and place it inside your `sm_translations` folder, which is right below your `sm_plugin` folder
